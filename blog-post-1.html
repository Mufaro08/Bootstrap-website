            add employee button click this option if you have a few employees to be registered enter employee ID number
            and employee name including middle name as per ID. Click verify a message will popup saying information is
            correct.

            If employee is married tick married and input spouse name and ID number also the system will ask if spouse
            of the tax payer is disabled, blind or has disabled children and tick accordingly this will give employee
            tax credits that reduce PAYE to be paid currently tax credits are annual usd 900 or usd 75 tax reduction per
            month. When done click save.

            For those who have a lot of employees click upload button next to the add employee button and download
            template input all employee data and when done upload , note the bulk employee registration form will not
            show spouse details so once registered you can go to employee name and then edit to input spouse names.

            All employees have to be registered regardless of them having tin numbers already the system will allocate
            the tin already registered to the employee, for those employees without a tin number ( tax identification
            number) will be allocated automatically.

            When done under employee you will see a list of employees employed by the company
        </p>

            Still under employee management sub tab employee on top right click generate employee earnings.

            A popup will appear asking to select tax year and tax period in this case we select 2025 and january. Also
            it will ask which paye calculation method is being used by company between average and forecasting method
            (note if you select one method its the one to be used on all future returnd until year end), system will ask
            for exchange rate use rate applicable on payroll date. Click submit and a message will appear saying empoyee
            earning generated and the system will move you from the employee subtab to the earnings tab.

            For those who have a few staff members below you will see all employees names go to the employee name one by
            one on right under actions click edit.

            When done you will see a section showing PAYE calculated and aids levy. Compare these calculations according
            to payroll if in order click save and move to next employee.
